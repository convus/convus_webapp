# General ignore
.DS_Store
dump.rdb

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/tmp/pids/*
!/tmp/pids/
!/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/storage/*
!/storage/.keep
/tmp/storage/*
!/tmp/storage/
!/tmp/storage/.keep

# Asset things
/public/assets
yarn-error.log
/node_modules
/app/assets/builds/*
!/app/assets/builds/.keep
esbuild_error

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/config/master.key
